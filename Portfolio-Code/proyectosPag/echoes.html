      <h3>My Role in the Project</h3>
      <p>
        My main focus was on the partial organization of the environment, ensuring smooth user mobility and spatial coherence. I developed an interactive piano puzzle where players must collect clues to perform the correct melody, which then triggers a narrative animation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the <strong>UI areas</strong>, I designed and implemented both the main menu and the pause menu, allowing users to customize their experience through adjustable settings. These include individual and master volume controls that synchronize with each audio layer, as well as lighting adjustments and mouse sensitivity options.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also worked with <strong>Timeline animations</strong>, using them not only for object movement but also for configuring bilingual subtitles (Spanish and English), ensuring accessibility and narrative clarity.

      <h3>What I Took From the Project</h3>
      <p>
        This project was developed collaboratively with a team of artists and another programmer. It provided me with invaluable experience in multidisciplinary teamwork and deepened my understanding of Unity’s tools for narrative and interactive design.
      </p>
      <p>
        It allowed me to discover new aspects of game development that truly inspire me, and to realize that there are always new challenges and opportunities for growth — something that genuinely excites me about this field.
