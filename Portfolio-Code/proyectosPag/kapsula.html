      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Kapsula - 12 </strong> is an interactive visualization project developed in Unity using the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). It invites users to explore a futuristic escape capsule from multiple perspectives, offering a hands-on understanding of its structure and purpose within a mysterious off-world mission.

        The experience combines technical precision with artistic direction, presenting a detailed yet stylized depiction of the capsule. Built with custom shaders and refined lighting, it leverages HDRP’s power to achieve realism and clarity without compromising performance. Subtle post-processing effects complement the design, emphasizing the balance between aesthetics and functionality.

      <p>
       Users can interact through UI controls or by manipulating camera viewpoints, navigating seamlessly between three exploration modes — exterior observation, interior inspection, and in-depth component analysis. Each layer of exploration reveals new mechanical and narrative details, turning a static model into an engaging storytelling device that connects visual design with interactive discovery.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
       While primarily a technical visualization, Kapsula-12 integrates contextual storytelling elements that spark curiosity and immerse users in the larger narrative of its imagined world.

    <!-- Mi rol -->
    <section class="project-role">
      <h3>My Role in the Project</h3>
      <p>
       My main contribution to Kapsula-12 focused on the design and programming of two interactive puzzles that enriched the user’s exploratory experience through visual and functional feedback systems.
      </p>
       <br>
      <p>
       The first was a modular pipe-connection puzzle, programmed using an event-driven architecture in Unity. Each module operated autonomously, triggering visual feedback through shader-based energy flow effects and line renderers when properly connected. This modular structure allowed for scalability, real-time updates, and smooth debugging throughout production.
      </p>
       <br>
      <p>
       The second system was an interactive sound-wave interface, where players adjusted frequencies and amplitudes in real time. Using procedural waveform generation through sine functions, Lerping, and coroutines, I achieved dynamic visual responses that synchronized with user input, creating a tactile and intuitive sense of progression.
      </p>
       <br>
      <p>
       Both puzzles were integrated using Unity’s Timeline system for synchronized feedback and transitions, ensuring consistency across the project’s diegetic interfaces. Through this work, I explored how technical systems can communicate narrative and emotion, blending functional design with interactive storytelling.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Took From the Project</h3>
      <p>
        Working on Kapsula-12 allowed me to deepen my understanding of how interactive systems can merge technical functionality with narrative intention. As one of the programmers, I was responsible for the implementation of the project’s core interactive mechanics — particularly the pipe and waveform puzzles — which challenged me to develop clean, modular, and scalable systems capable of supporting multiple layers of interaction.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Throughout development, I refined my skills in shader logic, coroutine management, and procedural visualization, learning how to maintain strong performance within Unity’s HDRP environment. Collaborating closely with artists taught me how to translate visual concepts into technical solutions that preserved the artistic vision while remaining optimized and functional.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
       This project strengthened my confidence in building interactive feedback systems that communicate clarity and immersion. It also reminded me that innovation often comes from iteration — that every problem solved opens up new creative and technical directions to explore.
