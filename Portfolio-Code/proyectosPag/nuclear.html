      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Nuclear Rush</strong> s a fast-paced endless runner where every second counts. The player takes the role of a worker trapped in a nuclear facility moments before a catastrophic explosion. With only one minute to escape, they must run, adapt, and survive while the world collapses around them.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Throughout the run, players encounter changing environments, hazards, and collectibles that transform their abilities. These transformations create a rhythm of intensity and adaptation, turning every attempt into a test of reflexes and precision. The experience blends urgency with replayability, encouraging players to master their timing and discover hidden details across multiple runs.

    <!-- Mi rol -->
    <section class="project-role">
      <h3>My Role in the Project</h3>
      <p>
      My main role in Nuclear Rush focused on level design, character movement systems, environment setup, and death logic implementation, working alongside another programmer as part of a two-person dev team.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I designed the level flow and pacing, using Unity’s modular segment system to build reusable structures that ensured smooth progression and consistent difficulty.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        For the character logic, I developed distinct movement systems for the Spider and the Bird — the spider featured dynamic speed and directional rotation based on key inputs, while the bird used rhythmic vertical impulses and gravity adjustments inspired by Flappy Bird. Both were fine-tuned with physics-based behaviors and coroutines for responsive and natural motion.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I also composed and decorated the environment to reflect the unstable, radioactive setting, and implemented death conditions tied to hazards and timing, enhanced through visual and audio feedback to heighten the game’s tension.

      <h3>What I Took From the Project</h3>
      <p>
        Working on Nuclear Rush helped me strengthen my understanding of how level design, environment composition, and gameplay logic come together to shape player experience.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I learned how to balance challenge and flow through spatial design and timing, while refining my approach to visual storytelling using interactive cues and environmental detail. Collaborating closely with teammates also improved my ability to merge artistic vision with technical precision, ensuring that every mechanic felt intentional and cohesive.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        This project reaffirmed my passion for designing spaces that are both engaging and reactive—where every obstacle, movement, and visual element contributes to the player’s sense of urgency and discovery.
